Pay. Attention!

**Now fork off!**

## The Game (that sadly was never given a proper title or attention to ANY detail up until *NOW!*üëè)
* Stop causing unnecessary friction towards the concept that is `(master/masterly/masters)`.
* It is not allowed to write things down in the game! (Not me comming up with that rule, frfr ü§¶)
* While Manoj is out and about - If he even gets TOUCHED he goes into isolation!
  * ... when he smokes DMT **alot** happens!
* Go listen to [Valeria Frattini](https://www.valeriafrattini.com) (on a streaming platform of choice!) - I'm her biggest fan!
  * See(k) out a local instansiation of [Sea of Shadows](https://sea.shadow/world-wide-wallop) after [Dan](/partakers-of-loitering) has started and maintained the company (on his expense!).
    * ... membership is free!

## A Set of ü´° General Instructions!
### misc

  * ... Further, I'm going to THE AMERICAS (Haven't been for a while, act!) s√• Swisha g√§rna lite more, d√•r√•! ü•∞
* If you didn't have my contact details before, why should you bother finding and using them now? (for other then the Swisha)
  * Elvis has left the building!
* ... instead, get cranking choosing your <i><b>q</b></i></li> domain! (keep it witty/finicky, spiritual and for life!)
* [Porkbun](https://Porkbun.com) usually have good prices due to their "at cost" program!
  * ... but for those so inclined [European Alternatives](https://european-alternatives.eu/) has some good European... Well, alernatives - LOL :D
  * Please [Domainr](https://domainr.com) take the site down! I need to get stuff done!! :P
    * How long before [domming.](https://domming.propelling.agency) is a better, more spiritual alternative?
* Buy the books on Amazon! (You can have email aliases on Proton Mail and Simple Login, just sayin')
* Amazon: Get cranking on "to-be-published-by-the-would-be-opposite."! Woho! (just mirror the repo, alr!)
* Why not add yourself to the [TiP (beta)](https://codeberg.org/jaw/tip) possibleness?
  * All adds gets rewarded 1000 ‚Ç¨! (According to protocol!)
* How long before TPB has a "pal.id" section?
  * ... or 'tracking.pal.id' is a thing?
* Is .krml happening? Or do we prefer .hgml?
* Don't bother with my "johannes.wirde@gmail.com", "johannes.wirde@pm.me" or "pattern.match@pm.me", I won't ever check those again!
* Buy and read the [book](/a-psychoticks-tale.com/), people! ... it really helps us out!

### The Webring
* An accepted pull request towards that of [pal-id/start-a-store](https://propelling.agency/pal-id/www) (the backend) wins a vegan icecream! :D (On the <a href="https://propelling.agency">PA</a>'s expense!)

### sub-rosa
* Those of you (private persons and companies alike) that has been gifted sub-rosa emails from me, use them wisely - If the adress ever gets emailed from any other email address not relevant I'll simply cut you off. (Ask first, maybe?)
* I *give* sub-rosa's when I so darn please.

### Mental Healthcare Ambulance
* The PA will definetly have one in ALL countries
  * ... and each of the [*A Skanner Darklies*](https://scanning.exchange), too!
  * ... and each of the [PoDS](https://pods.shop)?

### techies
* Pull-requesters:
  * ... no darn NPM!
  * ... No hidden messages in the code or other bullshit.
* Maybe check with [Gimply](https://g.co/gemini/share/4cfb5c52af2d) on how to start a revolution?
  * ... Also, do you think [kritters.](https://kritters.propelling.agency) is going to compete well with the other heavy hitters?
* [Plan.io](https://plan.io/): If we could upgrade to include Zulip, that'd be great!

### musick
* [SubKult](https://www.subkultfestivalen.se/): Get IAMX and NiN onboard for next year! (What will the ticket price be?)
  * 3TEETH: Should've bought you beers and energy drinks for metal bikram yoga, is SubKult 2027 a good enough pl√•ster p√• s√•ren? :D #pincolla
  * Once your "to-be-published-by-the-would-be-opposite"-subdomain is up, add a DNS TXT record stating "it-began-in.africa/sfx/&lt;URI&gt;" to a sound file of crappy quality and a maximum length of two sec!
    * ... containing a stellar spiritual message!
  * Also, [*maybe*](https://www.reddit.com/r/XFiles/comments/1naop77/i_made_this_credits_sound/)? Succesful relevant pul request winns a M&G with the concept (master/masterly/masters) in Berlin, Germany! 

### Bethard
* Where are we on the [cookie](https://www.animalhouseshelter.com/pets/devin/)...?
  * Private jet!
  * Silver platter!

### Publisdrive
* Is this public domain for you enough or are you hinting about becomming my first [gobble-gobble](/lawliest-agreement)?
  * ... or do you think there is an open-source solution with better reach "somewhere"?

### N26, et al
* WHAT IS THE DARN HOLD UP?!?!?!?
