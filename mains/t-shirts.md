Yes, just design the t-shirts and put them up! I don't have all the time in the world! (Yet!) etc etc frfr Go! üëè

(Going to be rather interesting to see the difference in designs between Redbubble and Spreadshirt, wouldn't we agree?)

1. Don't cause unnecessary friction!
2. Stop writing things down! (Sorry no sorry but I don't call the shots on this... It's in the book!)
   
... Either one of these would be hurtful to our presence!
